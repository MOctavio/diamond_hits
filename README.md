The game consists of hitting a diamond with a hammer as many times as possible in the given time-frame, the diamond figure will toggle its visibility making the task harder to accomplish and randomly a 'bomb' will appear to make you loose some points if you click it by mistake.

## Setup
- Make sure you have Ruby installed on your computer.
- Clone the repo.
- Run `bundle install`.
- Run `ruby diamond_hits.rb`.
