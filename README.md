# Diamond Hits
A pretty simple game made with Ruby and [Gosu 2D game development library] (https://www.libgosu.org/). 

The game consists of hitting a diamond with a hammer as many times as possible in the given time-frame, the diamond figure will toggle its visibility making the task harder to accomplish and randomly a 'bomb' will appear to make you loose some points if you click it by mistake.
